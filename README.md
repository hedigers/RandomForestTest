# Two Sample Testing Based on Random Forest (Replication Code)

We follow the line of using classifiers for two-sample testing and propose several tests based on the Random Forest classifier. The developed tests are easy to use, require no tuning and are applicable for \emph{any} distribution on $\R^p$, even in high-dimensions. We provide a comprehensive treatment for the use of classification for two-sample testing, derive the distribution of our tests under the Null and provide a power analysis, both in theory and with simulations.

## How to launch the simulation files 

- Install the Python module found on https://github.com/wittawatj/interpretable-test from Wittawat Jitkrittum via the command:
``pip install git+https://github.com/wittawatj/interpretable-test``
Once installed, you should be able to ``import freqopttest``.
- Install the R-package ``hypoRF`` found in ``\hypoRF_Code\hypoRF`` via `the R command ``install.packages("./hypoRF/", repos = NULL, type = "source")``.
- Make sure you have installed the R-packages ``ranger``, ``mvtnorm``, ``reticulate``, ``MASS`` and ``parSim`` (only necessary if you are interested in parallel computing).
- Launch the desired simulation R-file locally in the folder \hypoRF_Code\Replicate_Simulations.
If you want to save or plot any result, use the outcommented code at the end of each script.
